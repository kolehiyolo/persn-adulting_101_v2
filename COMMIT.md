Transaction.date and Transaction.category
1. alright so I went and changed the Transaction.date type to Date, but it didn't break anything lol
  1.1. that means there are tons of refactoring that's needed as there are most likely so many unnecessary parsing of data, which is why it didn't break
2. with that, I also added the Transaction.category property, which didn't break anything, and then removed the console.log in CalendarMonth
