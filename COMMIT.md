calendarHeadData working now
1. eyyyy okay so calendarHeadData is now working all well and good no problemos
2. well there is a problemo, in that the render is starting to CRAAAAWL, pace-wise
3. I very much need to upgrade the stack to make it faster, and I also need to rethink entirely the system
4. I am now on the way to upgrade to Next.js, DaisyUI, Zustand, and maybe Jest
5. another consideration is maybe the app can be faster once I actually use a proper DB/backend
6. whatever the case, I know I need this upgrade, and better now than later
