user can date pick via DateMover
1. alright so this now works, awesome
2. I noticed a bug though after trying the PY scripts, I adjusted the income to stop at 2058, and yes the transactions no longer show beyond that, but the calendarDates still show that date_change is positive, not good
  3. I tried running the individual script, which is generateCalendarDates.py, and it works
  4. definitely need to refactor these scripts soon
5. I also began a new ChatGPT thread cuz the original one is now CRAWLING
