CalendarMonth uses selectedCalendarDatesData
1. IT'S ALIIIIIVE
2. man performance is BLAZING render is pretty much instantaneous
3. lotso DX gaps discovered tho, such as redundant and inconsistent data types and variable naming
  3.1. definitely need a proper refactor sit down for this, but no need for now
  3.2. perhaps before we introduce CRUD for stuff
4. problem now is this only renders 2025 calendar months, simply cuz that's the data I had processed by the PY scripts, so we'll just change that ez
