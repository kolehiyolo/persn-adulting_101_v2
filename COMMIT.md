user can select the set, not working yet
1. so it's in the GUI, and the state is even already changing
2. but the actual fetching of the sets and applying to the shown data is NOT yet functional
3. I tried it so that it just runs the fetches again after selectedDataSet changes, but that throws errors and I don't have the patience to try fixing it
4. I'll just make it so the fetches fetch all sets, may be inefficient but who cares lol
