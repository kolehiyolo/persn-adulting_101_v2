Styling icon and color options
1. YOOO alright so yeah massive upgrade from the last commit, as the modal now looks kinda aight
2. The radio-buttons themselves are already as good as they'll ever look, but the form itself can still do a glow-up of course
3. At the very least they're now presentable as to being amenable to the dynamic rendering in that the abundance of options will be at least presentable
4. Part of this upgrade is doing some HTML rework of the components, grouping and labeling
5. I also had to finally remove the ModalAddAccount.scss overwrite of the text color, as now react-modal has a dark BG
