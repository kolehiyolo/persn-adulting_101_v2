runningTotal works!!!!
1. yo so i somehow stumbled onto making it work
2. i don't wanna have to explain it all, but involved refactoring CalendarMonth to have 2 processes, one getting the dates to show, and one preparing each dateData based on the dates
3. this also involved simplifying DateCard significantly as the processing mostly comes from the CalendarMonth side now
4. now I just want the data to be, well, accurate, cuz right now it sure as hell ain't
