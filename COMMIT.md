scrollbars now almost better
1. scrollbars now look better, and I just got GPT to give me code to emulate its native scrollbar look
2. my only issue now is, I can't get the scrollbar to show with padding to the left, so the left-side content doesn't directly touch it
3. another problem for another day, I suppose
