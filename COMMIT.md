Prepped Accounts data
1. Alright so the sample is ready, and I had to do some brain stuff to consider what data I should be putting on there
2. I exported the 1Money CSV cuz I know they also export the account data and I used it as a base, prepping in Google Sheets
3. It's very much lacking in depth as it only has name, amount, and currency, so I had to add a bunch more properties
4. I added goal, ID, date, time, order (for how it should be sorted in the UI), type, description, tags, archived, icon, and color
5. I also kinda went into prepping the Transactions data, but kinda just stopped short
6. I also decided to add a 4th data point, Icons, which will then have an ID that an Account or Category can use as Icon in the UI, duh
7. Exported the Accounts.csv and added it to the directory, as well as the original 1Money.csv
