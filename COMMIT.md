Refactor ModalAddAccount+ModalCustomizeIcon
1. With the help of GPT-kun, I refactored the code
2. Even with his help, I still needed cleaning it to fit my standards and ease-of-use-and-understanding
3. The functions within the components were getting confusing, so I needed to properly label which parts run on field changes, on modal opens, on submits, etc
4. I managed to make it quite smooth, DX-wise, and now I'm just itching to do more
