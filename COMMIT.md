calendar-dates-data run from 2000 to 2100
1. okay so I did a lot more than expected
2. I had to separate the 42-dates-per-calendar-month-processing cuz it was HEAVY
3. the individual generateCalendarDates.py scripts just borrow the "template"-ish calendar-dates.csv and fills in the appropriate missing properties that require transactions insight
4. exciting stuff, now onto NEW FEATUUUUURES
