Committing before the start
1. Alright so here I am finally getting to coding this thing
2. As a start, I already have some scripts done in Apps Script to automate the generation of the Google Sheets transactions, but clearly that isn't enough since I can't just keep using Google Sheets to keep track of my money
3. 1Money is already epic and awesome and very useful but it's not working for me in that it has a bunch of flaws/missing features that I need workarounds to compensate for
4. I'm tired of the workarounds and I'm pumped to do projects anyways so here we are lol
5. The first step is to build an MVP, that's it, and what I have in mind is simply building 1Money itself, but just the barest of functionalities for now, as long as it's usable in both desktop and mobile, as a browser web app for desktop and as a mobile app
6. What I want for now is simple CRUD for Accounts, Categories, and Transactions
