Better box icon
1. BROOOO alrightalrightalright so now BoxIcon works, but I ran into TypeScript issues when passing props that I had to debug for a while
2. I actually managed to finish this yesterday, but I didn't wanna commit because I didn't get to refactoring, and I don't want to refactor AFTER committing because I'll have a hard time tracking the changes I made
3. So now I refactored it, it's looking real good, and it works
4. For testing, I just have one SVG up in public/, and this SVG's icon.csv ID is what I used as dummy for all accounts.csv
5. I also set up another type for the icon
6. Many minute changes across the codebase but over lots of files so yeah this is a doozy to review
