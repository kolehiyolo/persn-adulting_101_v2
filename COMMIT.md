Add accountData to account on submit
1. YOYOYOYO alright so the new account is being added now on submit, and it even shows on whatever sub-tab it should show on
2. It even shows on the debts sub-lists, and also adds to the totals correctly
3. It was a very very straightforward process of implementing, in that I only changed props passing between App and PageAccounts so that PageAccounts has access to setAccounts, and then just have a very very brief line where we just append the new account to accounts
4. There were some issues, though, with ModalAddAccount, in that the default value for goal was '' if not a funds account, which is wrong as it should either be 'N/A' or a numberical value, but I corrected that now so ez
5. Also, another assumed big issue was the balance type, in that in the modal, by default, it's being treated as a string and should be, as sometimes the user will input '-', so I can't automatically parse the input value to a number type
  5.1. I considered doing some extreme conditional where I have a separate handleChange for the balance, and then it will detect whether the value can be parsed into a string for every change, but then I realized, just have it be accepted as a string for every change, BUT, when onSubmit, that's when we convert it to a number
