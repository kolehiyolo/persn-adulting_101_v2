transactions data more accurate now
1. alright so I put in my actual recurring transactions, as far as I can tell
2. there are some things that need fixing though to make it way more accurate
  . my april isn't done properly
  . my CC payments isn't perfectly planned
  . no debt to ate
  . no dental plan
  . no 2025 back to school plan
  . no optical plan
3. first thing, I gotta plan out the one time transactions, and have a python script that I execute and generates a total transactions csv
