Better list styling
1. Alright so for now I just made it so that the Navbar and the Main-Page elements are responsive, or at least stretching as needed, at a minimum width for now
2. I also did the classNaming thing I did with a previous project, where I have the classNames of a component in an array that is then joined, so that it's easy to edit the values as needed
3. The styling of the main-page dynamic was a major headscratcher and I even had to resort to recreating the scenario on Webflow as it's not behaving as I expected, but yeah managed to do it after
