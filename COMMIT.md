just fixed type casings
1. lol this was all about fixing the casing of the Transaction type properties
2. I updated the CSV column headers to lowercase
3. I updated the Transaction interface in types.ts
4. I update generateRecurringTransactions.py
5. I updated CalendarMonth, DateCard, and TransactionCard to reflect the casing change
6. that's it lol now I gotta actually change the Transaction type property types, which is gnarly to wrap your head around, but basically make amount and date into actual number and date values
