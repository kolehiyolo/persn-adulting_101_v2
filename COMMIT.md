Move DivAccountsListContainer to own file (Pt 2)
1. There we go PageAccounts just got way cleaner
2. The moving was lots easier than I expected, just literally cut code from one file to another
3. Of course some modifications had to be made, but mostly just component import and file path fixes
4. Also, for testing of how well the UI handles overflow, I added more dummy type:regular rows for accounts.csv
