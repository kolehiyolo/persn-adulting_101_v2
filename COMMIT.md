dateRunningTotal colors are now working somewhat well
1. the goal was to make the runningTotal change color gradually at certain "milestones", which can help us get a quick understanding of where our money is at at certain future points
2. it's now working, from red to purple, and it's just a matter of gradually tweaking it over time to see if the milestones make sense
