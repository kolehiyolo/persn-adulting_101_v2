Better BoxAccountsItem
1. Alright so totally revamped the component to be more like the original 1Money UI
2. I also have 2 components ready, BoxIcon and DivAmount, which I imagine I will use a lot in different places in the app, so I will have to compartmentalize those
3. The only issue right now is that for the icon itself, I'm using a placeholder, and there's no progress bar yet for accounts with goals
