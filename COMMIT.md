Override react-modal classes+styles
1. YO alright did it for both modals
2. I was afraid so many styles will be lost, but apparently it's just position:absolute and the inset property
3. This way, I can set the inset more deliberately, such as ModalAddAccount having 50px, and ModalCustomizeIcon having 100px, so ModalCustomizeIcon is always a tad smaller
