App.tsx already filters selectedMonth and transactions
1. this was a lot of work but it's done now
2. definitely need a lot of refactoring of EVERYTHING lol especially since this is a pretty major restructuring of the architecture, but I'm happy to just have this be in the future as I'm shooting for an MVP
3. the next step is making it actually work with CalendarMonth, which should SIGNIFICANTLY step up performance
