app head with calendarHeadData
1. okay I did a massive overhaul of App > main > head, where now it has calendarHeadData
2. I definitely need it to be a separate component at this stage
3. I also added a body container to App >  main
4. calendarHeadData now just has placeholder data, so I need to make it work
5. for now, compartmentalization is prio
