App refactored and styled
1. lotso changes for App.tsx, but mostly just refactoring, cleaning up code, formatting to my specific DX, and comment-bombing
2. besides that, I also properly set up App.scss, and prepared _variables.scss to have some mini-variables I know I'll be using lots
3. next is DateMover
