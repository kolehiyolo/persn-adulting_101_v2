Navbar working
1. Updated client directory, removing useless stuff, restructuring tree
2. Updated CSS files to SCSS
3. Added _variables.scss fetched from another project, but sorta just move down things I don't use and just keep them for future reference
4. Added Inter Google Font
5. Made Navbar functionality using react-router-dom, even added active state for the selected tab
6. Style the Navbar to at least show selected, proper padding and colors
