transactions data way more accurate now
1. just cleaned up data more
  . april is accurate
  . debt to ate logged
  . dental plan sorta ready
2. it's kinda sorta all accurate now
3. I just need to better style the whole thing and how the colors coordinate with the data
4. for example, I need better color coding for the types of transactions, whether they're income, borrowing from CC, monthly expenses, one time expenses, weekly expenses, massive expenses, etc
5. also, the running total now just shows green when it should have way more visual variety in different amount thresholds
6. beyond that, I need CRUD
