DateCard refactoring begun
1. aight so I started refactoring DateCard, which involves grouping code blocks into their proper places
2. one major thing I did was turn the component arrow function into a proper functional component
3. I decided to commit now as point 2 was a bit of a big change already so if I break something, at least I can revert to the version after this change
