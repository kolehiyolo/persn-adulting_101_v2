Styled ModalCustomizeIcon
1. LOVE ITTTTTT yeah
2. So yeah all good now with this Modal, but I want to take it further by modifying the width and height of it so that it's a bit smaller than AddAcccount, so that it's clear that it's another layer of popup with a parent behind it
3. I combined the modal buttons with the preview since the preview is a bit lonely
4. Reverted the body orientation to row, with the colors having smaller width than the icons since they're fewer
