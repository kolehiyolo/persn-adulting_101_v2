Added subdirectories to components/
1. Yeah okay so on the way to creating a modal component, I realized I don't know where I would put it, so I decided to add subdirectories to components/ to properly group them
2. Of course, upon moving, I had to fix some paths in the codebase
3. I also already installed react-modal
