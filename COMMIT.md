Python script for onboarding icons
1. Bruh just like that I had ChatGPT get me a script to create a CSV for my icons data from the folder of icons
2. I had to be very precise with how it should do it and damn it worked
3. I had to tweak it to make sure there's at least a 1 millisecond stagger for each row, because the icon IDs are generated dynamically via timestamp of when they were added to the CSV
4. I wanted to refactor it, but it's 8:54 already, and my sleep time is supposed to be at 9:00, so I'm pushing the refactoring for tomorrow, and for now I wanna focus on the next kinda big thing in the line
