Mounted BoxIcon in ModalAddAccount
1. Okay so before mounting ModalCustomizeIcon, I thought doing BoxIcon first would be best as a preview of the icon to clearly show that ModalCustomizeIcon is working after on submit there
2. I didn't expect that it will already be a big enough change that I think it warrants a commit
3. I needed to create a iconName state within ModalAddAccount, which I honestly didn't expect, so I just thought I'll commit now so I can focus solely on the ModalCustomizeIcon mounting in the next commit
