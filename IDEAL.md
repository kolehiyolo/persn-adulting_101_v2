- need to account for eventual finances split after debts are settled
- for now, we'll do 50/40/10
  - 50% or 60,000 of your income goes to needs (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.)
  - 40% or 50,000 goes to savings or debt repayment.
  - 10% goes to wants (entertainment, dining out, etc.)
- eventually 50/30/20
  - 50% or 60,000 of your income goes to needs (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.)
  - 30% goes to wants (entertainment, dining out, etc.)
  - 20% goes to savings or debt repayment.
- there needs to be a savings functionality in here, where we can toggle to see the savings growing
- in the same vein, we also need a way to see goals or debts being settled even slowly

- kren and i will tackle settling debts together for now
- both income will go to household income
- all expenses will be settled by household income until debts and buffer are settled
- some big expenses will need to be taken care of as we're settling the debt
- we will do 40% or 50,000 of monthly income towards a 50,000 buffer and settling debts
- once done, we will split our income and expenses
- recurring household expenses will be split evenly in half
- personal expenses will be split to each
- big expenses will be case by case split

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
great idea for auto+manual prioritization of expenses
we can have a table grid view of per month, with each expense shown in ascending order of date
this interface should collapse the non-negotiables by default, but users can toggle them on/off IF they want to alter them for that instance or moving forward IF they're recurring transactions
this interface can also have filters, so users can choose to hide/show certain transactions by categorizations or whatever
besides that, there should also be QUICK WINS showcase or something that highlights at which dates certain milestones or purchases are projected to be completed, such as debts cleared, or car purchaseable, etc
this is a table, so columns will be present for category, amount, priority, type, probably all of which are editable
the best case would be if this is draggable, awesome if possible
