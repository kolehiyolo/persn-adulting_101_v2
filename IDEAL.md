- need to account for eventual finances split after debts are settled
- for now, we'll do 50/40/10
  - 50% or 60,000 of your income goes to needs (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.)
  - 40% or 50,000 goes to savings or debt repayment.
  - 10% goes to wants (entertainment, dining out, etc.)
- eventually 50/30/20
  - 50% or 60,000 of your income goes to needs (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.)
  - 30% goes to wants (entertainment, dining out, etc.)
  - 20% goes to savings or debt repayment.
- there needs to be a savings functionality in here, where we can toggle to see the savings growing
- in the same vein, we also need a way to see goals or debts being settled even slowly

- kren and i will tackle settling debts together for now
- both income will go to household income
- all expenses will be settled by household income until debts and buffer are settled
- some big expenses will need to be taken care of as we're settling the debt
- we will do 40% or 50,000 of monthly income towards a 50,000 buffer and settling debts
- once done, we will split our income and expenses
- recurring household expenses will be split evenly in half
- personal expenses will be split to each
- big expenses will be case by case split
