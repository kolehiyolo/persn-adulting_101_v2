great idea for auto+manual prioritization of expenses
we can have a table grid view of per month, with each expense shown in ascending order of date
this interface should collapse the non-negotiables by default, but users can toggle them on/off IF they want to alter them for that instance or moving forward IF they're recurring transactions
this interface can also have filters, so users can choose to hide/show certain transactions by categorizations or whatever
besides that, there should also be QUICK WINS showcase or something that highlights at which dates certain milestones or purchases are projected to be completed, such as debts cleared, or car purchaseable, etc
this is a table, so columns will be present for category, amount, priority, type, probably all of which are editable
the best case would be if this is draggable, awesome if possible
